# Should we use a database for our Bullet Journal?

## Status
We all agree with this decision. We should use local storage first.

## Context
None of us is confident/proficient in using database, so we decided to implement the most basic version of the journal first which do not include the database.


## Alternatives
Using a database

## TA/Prof suggestions
Use local storage first.

## Decision
Use local storage first. If we still have time after implementing all other features, we could consider using the database.

## Consequences
The development process would be less stressful/easier.
We cannot spend an enormous amount of data.
We would not be able to have the login page anymore.
