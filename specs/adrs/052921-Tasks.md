# Title
Task Distribution and Prioritizing

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?  
accepted

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?  
Some of the tasks listed in May 24th's ADR were of high priority but weren't assigned, so we assigned ALL tasks in this meeting even if some of them will have to be re-assigned to someone else in the future. 

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

FINISHED TASKS *YAY*:  
3. Navigation (HARD: make the calendar not independent on the board) (Nada, Austin and Jialu)
2. More function components (linked to id dates, Pending assignment) 
2. Icon picture desings (Austin)

High priority assigned tasks:  
1. CI/CD 2 pages (Jialu and Nada)
2. Database (HARD: need to know how to store the data; currently plan to store locally; API?) (Siddharth) 
3. +New entry button in menu (Jiachen) 
4. Functional arrows (Jiachen but also pending conversation with Siddharth)
5. Picture component (Edward and Yuanzhe) 
6. Clicking on a date in the calendar directs to a corresponding journal entry (Julian and Rong but pending conversation with Siddharth )

Low priority assigned tasks:  
1. DMing the professor to have a meeting outside of OH (Jialu/Austin)
1. TODO list component (doesn't involve date) (Long) 
2. settings page (Alex, Nada, Jialu, Austin)
3. help page (Alex, Nada, Jialu, Austin)
4. any pages listed on the menu bar (Alex, Nada, Jialu, Austin)
5. [interface and design](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/cvJgwjeB8od4dJHW7jJqa63Favum6OhDvGUEELZUkfni2Hk64schi9d7eHTGJ5YS) (Alex, Nada, Jialu, Austin)

High priority not assigned tasks:  
NONE *YAY*

Low priority not assigned tasks:  
NONE *YAY*




## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?  
Implementing the program will be more organized and we now have a more solid schedule of internal deadlines. Every person voluntarily chose the task they were assigned to, and therefore everyone should be able to do a task that they know how to do and/or enjoy doing. 

## Alternatives
There's an infinite number of different distributions. :D
