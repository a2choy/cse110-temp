# Title
Task Distribution and Prioritizing

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?  
proposed

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?  
We haven't distributed tasks or broken down the BuJo program into pieces, so that's what we're doing (officially) right now. We have started distributed tasks on May 14th (can be found in the meeting notes on that day).

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

High priority assigned tasks:  
1. Database (HARD: need to know how to store the data; currently plan to store locally; API?) (Siddharth) 
2. +New entry button in menu (Jiachen) 
3. Navigation (HARD: make the calendar not independent on the board) (Nada, Austin and Jialu)

High priority not assigned tasks:  
1. Functional arrows (Pending assignment)
2. More function components (linked to id dates, Pending assignment) 

Low priority assigned tasks:  
1. Picture component (Edward and Yuanzhe) 
2. Icon picture desings (Austin)
3. TODO list component (doesn't involve date) (Siddharth) 
4. Clicking on a date in the calendar directs to a corresponding journal entry (Pending task 2 of high priority not assigned tasks)

Low priority not assigned tasks:  
1. settings page
2. help page
3. any pages listed on the menu bar

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?  
Implementing the program will be more organized and we now have a more solid schedule of internal deadlines. Every person voluntarily chose the task they were assigned to, and therefore everyone should be able to do a task that they know how to do and/or enjoy doing. 

## Alternatives
There's an infinite number of different distributions. :D
