## Suggestions from TA:
1. Form in the journal section can be simpler. It looks too complicated. Try to simplify the different type of input into a single button.
2. we can just have links, photo, text. Audio and video are hard to store. We can put these things into a website like GitHub and add the links to the Bullet list.
3. Using a iframe for the journal entry rather than a slidebar
4. get away from the log-in web if we don't use database
5. Consider about local sotrage on the fronter / web. 
6. Consider the right data structure. 
7. Implement the basic part and make sure that it works before we implement too many other functions.
8. Node.js for back end.
