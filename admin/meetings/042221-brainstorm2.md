## come up with new idea:
imagine the first time we open the project, what do we want to see?
   1. login page?
   2. team icons -- welcome to our journal! (welcome page,logo that goes away)
   3. create button(3 types): blank page where you can customize, project tracking section, journal entry of date/month/year(can drug down what they did (some lazy entries)), add a section for tracking goals/habbits (long-term vs short-term template); under each section, we could have different templates (specific or lazy template)
   4. prompt saying: have you used the moony raccoon before; yes or no; tutorials (intro video(easy), usage/functions of different buttons(doable?); buttons for documentations file/help? to check later(in the middle))
   5.  main page (home page)
      1. calendar
      2. Main Menu (put menu on the bar, put journal on main page) for navigation
      3. OR once enter, see today's journal first, navigate to other pages later as a bar
      4. OR Both: menu on side bar, journals on other side (the preferred one)
      5. what to see first?
   6. calendar

      2. click on a date on the calendar, see more details (like google calender)
