* Task1: App design
   * Participants: Everyone in the group
   * What made the team mad?
     *  None of us is  familiar with the backend/server(Qianjun)
      * We are all not experienced in the group development setting. We are too ambitious and wants to implement to many features, but we actually end up with not knowing what exactly should we implement(Nada)
      * None of us is super experienced with software design(Yuanzhe)
      * We have to learn the database tool but the labs do not touch the database. Also there are to many database frameworks to choose.(Sidd)  
   * What made the team sad?
     * We have to give up with many features that sounds really cool (Nada)
     * We are all in non SD timezone and all of the TA meetings are made based on SD timezone (Jialu)
     * We are all in different timezone so we wish we could have had a TA in our timezone (Sidd)
     * We only have 10 weeks for the course but the vast majority of the time was spent on planning/learning agile process which made it hard to give the project the time it deserved (Jiachen) 
   * What made the team glad?
     * We have a relatively good skeleton right now, and we have assigned each member something to do (Rong)
     * We have good ideas, and never have creative blocks. (Nada)
     * All of us have similar timezone so it's easier to schedule meetings
     * We have good team members and team leaders (Jialu) 
     * We have regular meetings with high attendances si everyone can participate(Qianjun)
    * Summary
      * We have good team members and team leaders (Jialu) (summary)

* Task2: CI/CI pipeline
    * Participants: Austin, Yuanzhe
    * What made the team mad?
      * The github course is not enough to learn the CI/CD pipeline (Nada)
      * We don't have access to environments(Alex)
      * Glad it exists in the github marketplace! Good that there is a starting point for us that is well made.(Nada)
    * What made the team sad?
      * Link to application will not work on remote commit, it must be pushed to the branch (nothing we can do but understandle because of github)
    * What made the team glad?
      * Work is already done by other people, we only need to customize that.(Alex)
      * Environments and rules require a review before committing to main branch which means we are paywalled
  
* Task3: Walking Skeleton
  * Participants: Qianjun, Rong, Long
  *  What made the team mad?
    * Adding the TODO list is too hard, may need to use statistics and complicated algorithm
    *  
  * What made the team sad?
    * We are again not familiar with the front end and the database backend. (Qianjun)
    * Worried about how to data storage (Rong)
  * What made the team glad?
    * When we look at the calendar we have a very standardized calendar that's built in (pure 100% vannila js) and it comes with many useful functions like dataonclick() (Qianjun)
    * Now it's easy to add future components without thinking about variable/function overlap (Rong)
  
* Summary
  * What was good?
    * Happy for our team members and leaders. Eveyone is contributing and the work is divided equally. (Jialu)
    * The skills we gained after doing this project will be continuously useful for us in the future (Sidd)
    * The experience of working with a team is good and we are organizing ourselves better (Alex)
    * Agile and other more methodology related things will be useful no matter what language/job we have (Austin)
    * The efficiency of our meeting has been improved a lot (Edward)
  * What was bad?
    * We start coding relatively late (Rong)
    * We weren't able to make decision because we are not able to evaluate how easy or hard a task is (Nada)
    * We need to decide whether we need to use a database
  * What should we start doing?

    * Starting planning ahead and finish assignments earlier
