* color palette is greens, nudes, and occasionally animal prints or plant/flower colors
* Qianjun, Siddharth, and Nada are in charge of ppt themes
* Rong created and documented our decisions in team.md
* team intro video will be ~10 seconds per member. common theme is we all jump in to the frame of the video. start by saying "this is the moony raccoon". and say one of our values.
