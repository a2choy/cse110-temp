### Agenda
* Austin leading the meeting
* adding screenshots to [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16zqo4iG3lYxhP0hweLESaA8nTn7TLbT8) until we collect them, then we're adding them to the gituhub (Jialu)
* Discussed what we have accomplished so far (while Jialu is adding proof screenshots)
* Answering this question individually: how do you feel about our progress so far? and what worries you in our plan?
  * Nada Galal: generally feeling good after the walking skeleton (thanks to Rong, Long, and Julian). like how we assignd tasks. worried about (1) having free riders in small groups/pairing (2) losing our pace (not finishing everything we want to finish on time).
  * Yuanzhe Liu: feeling good. we have the walking skeleton. maybe need better communication inside small groups/pairings that are in charge of task. 
  * Jiachen Ma: likes how we assigned every team member a task to be done by next week. would like to do that in every Tuesday meeting so that our project doesn't lose its pace or track.
  * Austing Choy: agrees with Edward
  * Edward Tian: at least every week check progress (in wednesday meetings), and discuss what we're doing in the second half of the week.  
  * Alexandre Marques: might be a little bit behind the other groups, but we should be fine if we don't overcomplicate our program.
  * Rong Zheng: we already assigned tasks, we should be good if everyone finished their work on time.
  * Jialu Sui: everything make more sense and clear after we simplified our project. the project is very doable with the current plan.
* all screenshots are in the github under admin/meetings/051521-sprint-1-review/
