## Team Values
 * We value efficiency because it is is vital in agile software development or even in our fast-paced modern life.
 * We value orderliness because it makes things organized, which enables us to live and work in a comfortable environment.
 * We believe that trust is important in a team. But trust is built upon everyone's actions. We should depend on each other's work to gain trust from teammates.
 * We value connection because, as humans, we survive and develop because of the connection with nature. Connection is necessary for a team project because an individual is limited without the help from the teammates or reference.
 *  We strive to be goal-oriented because goals provide governance to vision and mission and help us stay on track.
 *  We are open to learning. We will take the comments from each other and improve ourelves with each other's valuable opinions.
 *  We are willing to listen to each other, not only about the project but also all other things happening in our lives.
 *  We appreciate one another, and we appreciate each of our ideas and efforts.
 *  We will work with each other and help each other. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”
 *  We will be committed to the team, build rapport with teammates, and make efforts for the team.
 *  We will be responsible to our team. Complete our tasks on schedule, and to the highest standard.
