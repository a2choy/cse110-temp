## Last Checkpoint:
Alexandre Marques was assigned the task of testing our program, he has written unit tests for all methods that do not involve directly loading information from the website or database as that is not possible with unit testing. These tests take a look at all the behaviours the code could do with input from the code, this is because many of the functions are called by other functions with specific inputs, so there is a limited amount of inputs to be tested.
When it came to automated testing the tests remain the same, due to a conflict with babel packages (preset-env does not allow for async testing, using es2015, polyfill, and stage-0 fixes this but then give an import error). Tests were conducted by hand and some bugs were found and corrected. However, after the failed attempt to implement automated testing the irrelevent packages have been removed and files like .babelrc have been simplified.
One small change in the workflow, was that a file was made to be ignored during the linting process because we imported it and it was styled into one incredibly long line of code.
