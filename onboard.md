Click the save button on the top right corner after finish editing the journal of each day. The content of the journal will be reloaded when needed. If it fails to reload, open the browser developer tool -> Application -> Storage -> IndexedDB. You'll see two databases. Delete them and try again.

#### Clone & Set up things locally:
You can use the regular way to clone the repo to your local. If you wish to deploy it, push the repo to your own Github repo and set github pages to deploy. Notice that the index.html is inside /source/Journal_Draft_v1, so make sure the link is correct after the deployment.

It contains our **Statement of purpose**, **identified problems**,**possible risk and rabbit holes**,**5 user personas** who might be our targer users, and the **initial design** of our bullet journal webpage.
